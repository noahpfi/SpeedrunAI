## Introduction

This is the public archive of the SpeedrunAI / PvPBots / Statues plugin for MC spigot servers.

**SpeedrunAI aka PvPBots is a server plugin for adding fake players to Minecraft.**

Features include:
- Spawn as many as you want
- Bots are able to navigate and interact with the world autonomously
- Bots have the same player mechanics as real players (damage, effects, portals, everything)

By customizing the code:
- Make the bot do whatever you want in the [Controller.java] (renamed to [PvP.java](src/main/java/com/swirb/pvpbots/client/PvP.java))
- Newer versions support

## Discontinued since 06/22

At the time I started working on this there weren't many bot plugins around, all very glitchy and with many big limitations. There was also no info on how to create one other than these plugins, which where all for older mc versions.

This repo is here for anyone to help to build a decently modern bot plugin for mc versions 1.16 and above.

## Possible solutions for issues you might have

**After going through the end portal back to the overworld, the bot has disappeared**
No it hasn't. It is sitting through the end credits lol.

## Fyi

If I remember correctly, shortly before discontinuation **I updated the plugin to mc version 1.18 and a few minor things broke (i think block placing).** The plugin was originally developed for version 1.16.1.

The showcase video may be cool, but i lost the [Controller.java] (renamed to [PvP.java](src/main/java/com/swirb/pvpbots/client/PvP.java)) code which means this functionality is lost until someone recodes it.

My username was formerly Swirb, just to clear up any confusion
